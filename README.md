# FabricHax

A collection of hacks to automate repetitive tasks and make your life easier.

## Setup

To build the project jars, run `gradlew build`

For detailed IDE-specific instructions please see [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup).

### Usage

Use `gradlew runClient` to launch a test environment.

To use it with your minecraft installation, copy the jar generated by `gradlew build` to `.minecraft/mods/`, with the [fabric api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).
