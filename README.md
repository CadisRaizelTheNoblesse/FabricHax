# TODO
This project is actively under development, we appreciate every bit of help :)

* Testers 
	* Don't know how to code? We still need testers! All you need to do to get started is clone this repository, run `gradle build` in the repository folder, and run the jar (requires java to be installed). If you find bugs, please create an incident, and include ALL of the following:
		* Your computer's Operating System, and version
		* Java version (open a terminal and type `java -v`)
		* What version of Minecraft you are running
		* What you tried that caused an error
		* Any other info that can up pinpoint the error

* Coders
	* Good with Java?
		* Minecraft mods are all the rage, help us by making new, clever mods!
		* Help format, document, comment, and reorganize code.
		* Try testing this project with different JDK's, it will help pinpoint requirements needed for this project. 
	* Groovy programmer?
		* There are more gradle commands we could implement, try adding new gradle commands, comment on current ones, and help new users get up to speed faster!
	* GitHub Actions?
		* If you know how to build GitHub Actions pipelines, we could use some help building a pipeline that tests this code! In a `.yaml` file, configure a builder that tries to run the code. If the code runs without errors, then we know the latest commits to this project are working correctly.

	* Others
		* We are constantly looking for new ideas to add to this repository. If you think of a mod that could be useful, **document it**. Thoroughly describe what the mod should do, and why it could be helpful.
